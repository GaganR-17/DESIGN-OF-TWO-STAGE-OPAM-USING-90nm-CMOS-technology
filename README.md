# DESIGN-OF-TWO-STAGE-OPAM-USING-90nm-CMOS-technology
A two-stage op-amp in 90 nm CMOS uses a differential input stage and a common-source gain stage with Miller compensation for stability. It provides high gain, low power, and low-voltage operation, making it suitable for ADCs, DACs, sensor interfaces, and biomedical applications.
